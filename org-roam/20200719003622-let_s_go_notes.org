* Let's go

This note is my personalized brain dump from Let's GO book by Alex Edwards.

** Notes
*** Routing table

| Method | pattern         | Handler       | Action                     |
|--------+-----------------+---------------+----------------------------|
| Any    | /               | home          | Display home page          |
| Any    | /snippets?id=1  | showSnippet   | Display a specific snippet |
| POST   | /snippet/create | createSnippet | Create a new snippet       |



*** Customizing HTTP headers
- Go always attempts to set the correct =Content-Type= Header automatically using the [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#DetectContentType][http.DetectContentType]] method. The common problem here is that this function can not distinguish JSON from plain text. So each time the correct header must be set manually.

  Example:
  =w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")=

- When we use the in-built methods =Set()=, =Add()= etc on the =Header= map, the header name will always be cannonicalized using the [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/textproto/#CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey][textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey()]] method.

  To avoid this the headers can directly set to the Header map.
  =w.Header()["X-XSS-Protection"] = []string{"1; mode=block"}=

- =Del()= method doesn't delete the system generated Headers. To suppress these we need to manually assing =nil= to the respective header.

  =w.Header()["Date"] = nil=
