* Thoughts on hackintosh

I love the idea of running mac os on my own hardware. I absoultely love mac os because it's stable, extremely beautiful and developer friendly. But with hackintosh I don't think I am gonna enjoy the same stability that I enjoy with apple hardware.

Also I would like to go with ryzen processors and Nvidia gpus. That won't work with hackintosh as it doesn't support the latest Nvidia GPUs. So either I have to go with something like
1. ryzen cpu + AMD graphics
2. intel cpu + AMD graphics
3. 9th gen intel cpu(Integrated graphics) + whatever gpu(for windows)

That also makes me rethink whether I wan't to invest in expesive hardware that may or may not fully support mac os.
