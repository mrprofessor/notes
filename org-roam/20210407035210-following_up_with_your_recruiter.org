    Hi YYY,
        I wanted to thank you for helping coordinate my interview last week, and I also wanted to check in about my interview status. Do you know when I could expect an update?

    Hi YYY,
        I just wanted to check in again. I understand you’re probably busy with other work, so I’ll probably just give you a call tomorrow or the next day if I haven’t heard back from you before then.

    Thanks!
